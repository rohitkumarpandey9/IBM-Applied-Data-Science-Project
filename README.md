# IBM Applied Data Science Project
# Project-Product Demand Prediction with Machine Learning
## Problem Statement:-

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust machine learning model that accurately forecasts product demand. By leveraging historical sales data and external factors, we aim to assist businesses in optimizing their inventory management and production planning, ultimately enhancing their ability to meet customer needs efficiently.

Phase 1:- 

Data Collection
In the initial phase of this project, we will focus on gathering the essential data required for demand prediction. This includes historical sales data and external factors that significantly influence product demand, such as marketing campaigns, holidays, economic indicators, and more.

Tasks:-

   Collect historical sales data.
   
   Acquire external factors data.

Phase 2:- 

Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a critical step in the development of our predictive model. During this phase, we will focus on cleaning and transforming the data to ensure it is ready for model development. This involves handling missing values, converting categorical features into numerical representations, and guaranteeing data quality.

Tasks:-

Clean the historical sales data.

Preprocess external factors data.

Handle missing values.

Convert categorical features into numerical representations.

Phase 3:- 

Feature Engineering
Effective feature engineering can significantly enhance the predictive power of our model. In this phase, we will create additional features that capture seasonal patterns, trends, and external influences on product demand. Additionally, we will consider time series forecasting techniques like ARIMA or Prophet to capture temporal patterns in demand data.

Tasks:-

Create additional features to capture seasonal patterns and trends.

Engineer features representing the impact of external factors on demand.

Explore time series forecasting techniques for capturing temporal patterns.

Phase 4:-

Model Development
In this phase, we focus on building and training machine learning models for demand forecasting. We explore various algorithms and techniques, evaluate their performance, and select the most suitable model for accurate predictions.

Tasks:

Select and implement machine learning algorithms.
Train and fine-tune models.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
Select the best-performing model.

Phase 5:- 

Model Evaluation and Deployment
After developing the machine learning model, it's essential to evaluate its accuracy and effectiveness. We conduct rigorous testing to ensure the model meets the project's objectives.

Tasks:

Conduct comprehensive model evaluation.
Analyze and interpret model results.
Refine the model if necessary.
Deployment
Once the model is successfully developed and evaluated, we focus on deploying it for practical use. In addition, comprehensive documentation will be provided to ensure that the model can be used by businesses for demand forecasting.

Tasks:

Deploy the model for production use.

Documentation
This project aims to provide a valuable tool for businesses to optimize their inventory management and production planning by accurately forecasting product demand. Through data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and deployment, we aim to deliver a robust solution that improves operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Conclusion:-

Through this project, we've not only provided businesses with accurate demand forecasts but also empowered them with the tools to optimize their operations and customer satisfaction. The accurate predictions and valuable insights derived from this project are expected to result in enhanced operational efficiency, ultimately leading to business success.

For future directions, we will continue to refine the model based on feedback and evolving market dynamics. We also aim to expand our predictive capabilities to capture emerging demand patterns and further improve inventory management and production planning.

For further details and updates on the project's progress, please refer to the respective documentation and reports associated with each project phase. We look forward to the positive impact our work will have on businesses and their ability to thrive in dynamic market environments.
